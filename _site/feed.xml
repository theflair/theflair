With this phone one plus is trying 
to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let’s see in the article below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before taking a deep dive into the phones, let’s see what specs this phone has to offer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered dark&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Specifications&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Processor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 865&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rear Camera&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Quad Cameras 48MP(f/178) + 48MP(Ultra Wide) + 8MP(3x Zoom) + 5MP(Color Sensor)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;front Camera&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16MP&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Display&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6.78 inches 120HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio:19.8:9)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Connectivity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5G, WIFI 6 Support&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Battery&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4510mAH(30T warp charging)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fingerprint&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Water Resistant&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Water Resistant(IP 68)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Charging&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 30W) + 3W(Reverse Wireless Charging)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have carefully observed the specs, this phone includes an IP Rating as well as wireless charging.
This shows that one plus is not trying to cut corners against the best of samsung and apple but instead giving it all to take them head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phone pricing in India is not out yet but if we consider the US pricing which is 899$ 
converting it into INR we can estimate the price to be at around 68k with this price it 
still manages to undercut the iphone 11 and galaxy s20.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking about the design, it has a single punch hole curved display similar to galaxy s10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The highlight of this phone has to be its &lt;strong&gt;120Hz AMOLED&lt;/strong&gt; display which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display.(For people who are unaware of DisplayMate its like DXO Mark for Displays).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming to the camera its a quad camera setup and on paper can take on the other flagships nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Build quality with its glass body attached together by a metal has always been good but this time it also added dust and water resistance which is rated as IP 68(fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand and are resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater for up to thirty minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-f-b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking about battery life, this phone comes with a 4510mAH capacity which is fairly good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance is also great coming with snapdragon 865 processor.
This phone also supports 5G and WIFI 6 making it a future proof phone. The software thats the oxygen OS gives the cleanest andriod experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: One Plus ended up making a really appealing flagship smartphone undercutting the likes samsung and apple by a good margin and offering way more specifications at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="oneplus" /><category term="android" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">It has been 6 years since one plus has been making smartphones until last year the company has produced a lot of flagship killer but the company from the past year has changed its strategy to produce a true flagship with its one plus 7 pro and 7t pro they were good but lacked the bells and whistles that a true flagship from samsung and apple had.

kept on increasing from generation to generation. So, is this new One plus 8 a “flagship killer or a wallet killer”, lets find out in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lets talk specs for a while, it’s powered by the top of the line Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, which comes with a 6.55 inches AMOLED with a 90HZ refresh rate, which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display.(For people who are unaware of display mate its like DXO Mark for Displays).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming to the camera its a triple camera setup the main sensory and the wide angle are the same found on the one plus 7t which are 48MP and 16MP respectively and the third sensor is replaced by a macro lens to capture closeup shots. The selfie shooter is a 16MP sensor which is the same one found on the one plus 7t. The battery capacity is 4300 mAh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-f-b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2020 oneplus 8 &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phones pricing in India at this point of time is unknown but if we consider the price of 
this phone in US,We can expect a price at about 53,000 Rupees which is almost 13,000 price increase from the one plus 7t which was 37,999 rupees at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 13k price increase brings a new design change to the front which is punch hole display with curved edges(similar to the one found in the galaxy s10). The same old 90hZ display which is much brighter for better outdoor use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phones also comes with a slightly improved stereo speakers setup with dolby atmos support.The standout feature of this phone has to be the support for 5G and wifi 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that one plus, for this time has ended up making a wallet killer. If what you really want 5G we have much cheaper options from namely the realme X50 and if you want the smooth experience of oxygen OS. The older one plus phones namely the 7t can give you the same experience for much lesser price. One plus 8 is meant for people whose first priority is design, oxygen OS and 5G in a single package.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="oneplus" /><category term="android" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">One Plus is now 6 years in smartphone making.Its strategy was always to launch a phone that brought with it a flagship experience but not so expensive as a flagship but as years passed by its pricing kept on increasing from generation to generation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 March, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;
One week ago, President Donald Trump held a press conference wherein he claimed Google would be building a screening website for the coronavirus that would direct people to testing sites. As we learned in the following days, that wasn’t true. Google’s sister company Verily did launch such a site, but only for the Bay Area and reportedly it only offered tests to a very small number of people. Google, however, did say it would launch some sort of website and after a small delay, it’s here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the website and potentially more importantly, Google will start providing more enhanced information cards for people who search for terms related to the coronavirus. There will be information tabs for symptoms, prevention, global statics, and locally relevant information. It will look a bit like this:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/COVID_19_MOBILE_SEARCH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;near by hospitals search result&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/covid19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;google.com/covid19&lt;/a&gt;. It does have useful resources, including a card that mimics what you see above. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-people-covid-19-information-and-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s post announcing the site&lt;/a&gt; says that you will be able to find “state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses.” Google emphasizes that it’s pulling information from “authoritative” sources like the WHO and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only available in English right now, but a Google spokesperson tells The Verge that Spanish language support is soon to follow. The site was also designed with accessibility in mind, including with the larger fonts that Google usually uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website has videos in ASL, a global map showing confirmed cases by country, and plenty of information about Google’s other relief efforts — plus some feel-good YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through that description, however, you’ll notice that it doesn’t include what Trump originally claimed it would. The nearest thing to finding a test is a drop-down menu that provides links to local websites — for example, choosing California provides a link to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDC has a “self-checker” chatbot&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft helped build, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/ih47JgriBzLY0nXEbncs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WSJ quoted an executive from a healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt; who put in a realistic context: “It’s just something consumers need now to help with anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, lots of big tech companies are making efforts to provide coronavirus-related support, but none of them are able to solve some of the biggest problems in the pandemic: access to testing and the impending crisis in our healthcare infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, Google may actually provide a questionnaire and information about local drive-thru testing locations. But a spokesperson says that the company won’t do so until there’s authoritative and trustworthy information on those sites. That could be a long time coming, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="corona virus" /><category term="google" /><category term="outbreak" /><category term="general" /><summary type="html">Google had launched a new India specific Caronavirus site containing Health Information, Safety and precautions tips, Data &amp;amp; Insighs and Resources to help.

The company said it’s shutting down the app on May 12, as the project didn’t take off as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search giant first unveiled the app in May 2018 as a test in the Indian city of Mumbai to let you explore your neighborhood with help from local experts. Later in November, it expanded its base to a few more cities in the country. However, it failed to gain traction, likely because it simply didn’t have enough users to deliver an engaging experience. It never even came out of beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an email sent to customers, Google mentioned that the community answered over a million questions related to their localities, but the project didn’t grow the way the company had hoped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We launched Neighbourly as a Beta app to connect you with your neighbors and make sharing local information more human and helpful. As a community, you’ve come together to celebrate local festivals, shared crucial information during floods, and answered over a million questions.&lt;/i&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But Neighbourly hasn’t grown as we had hoped. In these difficult times, we believe that we can help more people by focusing on other Google apps that are already serving millions of people everyday.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google also pointed towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/localguides&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Maps Local Guide&lt;/a&gt; to help people in your region find answers related to the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes at an interesting time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus/#Community-Help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook just rolled out a ‘community help’ feature&lt;/a&gt; for people to request or offer assistance in their neighborhoods during the coronavirus crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is closing down on May 12; you’ll be able to download your Neighbourly content until October 12. Another one for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://killedbygoogle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The company said it’s shutting down the app on May 12, as the project didn’t take off as expected. The search giant first unveiled the app in May 2018 as a test in the Indian city of Mumbai to let you explore your neighborhood with help from local experts. Later in November, it expanded its base to a few more cities in the country. However, it failed to gain traction, likely because it simply didn’t have enough users to deliver an engaging experience. It never even came out of beta. In an email sent to customers, Google mentioned that the community answered over a million questions related to their localities, but the project didn’t grow the way the company had hoped: We launched Neighbourly as a Beta app to connect you with your neighbors and make sharing local information more human and helpful.

However, the problem arises when you have to look for global data. For instance, I am located in India and if I have to check what’s trending on the US Play Store, I would have to change my Google account location. Tedious! Recently, I stumbled upon a website that lets you check the trending apps in every country and even the app trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite helpful if you are an app developer and want to understand the trend of the market. It’s also helpful if you are a journalist who covers technology and currently trending apps. It helps you gauge the type of apps that are becoming popular within different countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-find-trending-apps-in-any-country&quot;&gt;How to find trending apps in any country?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/us/all/top-free&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Similar Web tool&lt;/a&gt; and select the country. For instance, I have selected the United States as the country whose trending apps I want to see. Now, click on the “Go” button on the extreme right side. You will see the list of apps that are currently trending on the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/apps/play_store.png&quot; title=&quot;Play Store Leader Board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website also lets you see trending apps on the Apple Play Store. In the first drop-down, you can select the store as “Apple App Store” and let other options as default. Click on the go button and it will populate the trending apps on the Apple store. Additionally,  you will also see an “iPad/iPhone” toggle on just below the Go button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/apps/app_store.png&quot; title=&quot;App Store Leader Board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different filters besides the App Store and the country. You can filter out apps based on categories like Fitness, Music, Productivity, etc. Moroever, you have a control to view popular paid apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the website shows you app trends as well. It’s a separate tab with multiple sections on it. One of the sections shows you apps that have become recently become popular and are new in the top 100 list. In addition to that, there’s a section that shows apps that have climbed their way and have increased their ranking in the top 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/apps/app_trends.png&quot; title=&quot;App Trends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If someone were to access it, they’d effectively have access to the rest of your online identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just hoping that hackers don’t find you, take 10 minutes and secure your Gmail account right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-a-strong-password&quot;&gt;Use a strong password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect we’re all guilty of reusing simple passwords at some point – I admit that I used to. But reusing passwords across multiple sites and services is just asking for your accounts to be hacked. All it takes is a leak or breach at one service, and hackers will begin trying to sign in to all of your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to step up your password game. Use unique, randomly generated passwords, for every online account you have. Keeping track of all those passwords is easy when you use a password manager. We have a roundup of the best password managers available, both free and paid, if you need help with deciding which one to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change your Google account password, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google account security page&lt;/a&gt; and click on Password under the Signing in to Google section. Verify your password if prompted, then enter your new password – generated by your password manager – and click Change password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enable-two-step-verification&quot;&gt;Enable two-step verification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without two-step verification, also commonly called two-factor authentication, hackers only need your password to access your entire Google account – including YouTube, Gmail and Google Pay. And remember, if you reuse the same password for multiple services, they could get it from a data breach or through a phishing scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With two-step verification, sometimes called two-factor authentication, hackers would need your password and a randomly generated six-digit passcode or physical access to your phone before they could gain access to your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn on 2SV by visiting your &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google account security page&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on 2-Step Verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/two_factor_authentication.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two Step Verification&quot; title=&quot;Two Step Verification&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the prompts until you reach the section in the screenshot above. Once there, decide whether you want to receive push alerts in the Gmail app to approve login requests (the default option), or if you want to use random passcodes. Using alerts in the Gmail app is easier, but it means you have to have your phone nearby at all times. You’ll also need a connection to approve the alert. So, if you’re somewhere where you have no bars – like on a plane, for instance – you’ll need to be connected to Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to use a passcode, you can receive it via text message or access it in a password manager. I use a password manager to manage my 2SV codes so I can access the codes on any device, regardless of whether I have a data connection on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you opt to use alerts, click &lt;strong&gt;Try it now&lt;/strong&gt;. You should receive an alert on the phone that was listed on the screen. Follow the rest of the prompts to complete setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use passcodes, however, click on &lt;strong&gt;Choose another option&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;Text message or voice call&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your phone number, and then enter the code to activate two-step verification. After entering the code and clicking a few more buttons, 2SV will be turned on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/choose_option.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two Step Verification&quot; title=&quot;Two Step Verification&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, wait, you’re not done yet. Though 2SV via texted passcodes is more secure than not using 2SV at all, I recommend using push alerts if possible. SIM-swap fraud is becoming more common, allowing hackers to take over your phone number and receive 2SV codes meant for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you must rely on passcodes, take a few extra minutes and set up an Authenticator app for your Google account. You can either use Google’s Authenticator app or a password manager. Click on Set Up under the Authenticator app section and then select the type of phone you use. Use your preferred app to scan the QR code, then enter the passcode generated by your app to verify everything is set up properly and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/authenticator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Googole Authenticator&quot; title=&quot;Google Authenticator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick side note: There’s yet another, even more secure option for locking down your Google account that uses a physical security key which you can read more about here. For most people, however, carrying around an extra device isn’t a realistic option. At a minimum, you should turn on 2SV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew. That was a lot of work, but trust me, it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-your-backup-contact-methods&quot;&gt;Check your backup contact methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the time that you first set up your Gmail account, you may have changed your phone number, or ditched an old email account. So it’s a good idea to double-check your backup contact methods. This is what Google will use should you get locked out of your account to verify you’re the account owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and look for the section titled &lt;strong&gt;Ways we can verify it’s you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on each section – &lt;strong&gt;Recovery phone&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Recovery email&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Security question&lt;/strong&gt; – and update them with current information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google/backup_google.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Account Backup Methods&quot; title=&quot;Google Account Backup Methods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if this information is out of date and you get locked out of your account, Google won’t be able to verify you own the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;look-at-account-activity&quot;&gt;Look at account activity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that a hacker (or an ex) is accessing your account without your knowledge. To check, sign in to your Gmail account and scroll to the bottom of the page. You’ll see a line that says “Last account activity…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;account_activity.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of that line, click &lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt; to see when, how and where your account is being used. If you suspect any unkosher activity, click on the button labeled &lt;strong&gt;Sign out of all other Gmail web sessions&lt;/strong&gt; and immediately change your password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve secured your Gmail account, take a few more minutes to lock down your Amazon account. Then, do the same for your Facebook account and your Apple account while you’re at it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="internet" /><category term="security" /><category term="computers" /><category term="mobile" /><category term="hacking" /><summary type="html">From bank statements to personal letters, and even password reset requests, your Gmail account holds an abundance of personal information.

The software giant is making the preview version, which lets you stream Xbox games to a PC, available to all Microsoft employees. The Verge has been able to obtain exclusive screenshots of how xCloud will work on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has developed an Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows 10 that will be available in the Windows Store. Much like the Android or iOS versions, the app requires a Bluetooth Xbox One controller, a Microsoft account, and a good internet connection. The PC app will also support streaming games from an Xbox One console locally or remotely, instead of using Microsoft’s xCloud server blades.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/microsoft/xcloudpcwindows10_6.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of games available to Microsoft employees to test, but the app is currently limited to 720p streams for now. “This internal preview is running at 720p resolution with 1080p just around the corner,” reveals an internal Microsoft support note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience is very similar to what is available on Android and iOS, even down to the user interface and the way you access and stream games. It certainly looks ready to be tested broadly, and it’s likely that Microsoft will roll this out to external Xbox testers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also recently upgraded its xCloud server blades to include eight Xbox One S consoles in a single server instance. That’s up from the four the company was previously testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=”/assets/images/microsoft/xcloudblade.jpg” title=”Microsoft’s xCloud Server” alt=”Microsoft’s xCloud Server”;”/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now working to eventually transition these xCloud servers to the Xbox Series X processor. This next-gen processor is far more powerful and capable of running four Xbox One S game sessions simultaneously on a single chip. It also includes a new built-in video encoder that is up to six times faster than the current external encoder that Microsoft uses on existing xCloud servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has committed to launching xCloud this year, with PS4 controller support and this Windows 10 streaming on the way. The Xbox maker is planning to integrate Project xCloud with Xbox Game Pass later this year, allowing players to stream games from the company’s subscription service directly from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
