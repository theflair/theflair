&lt;p&gt;Firefox has improved a lot lately and is a better choice specially from the privacy point of view. However, if you are an ardent fan of Google Chrome, I won’t force you to ditch Chrome and move to Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse chrome is available for linux, but Google Chrome is not an open source and if you try to install Google Chrome from Ubuntu Software Center, you won’t find it there. It will probably suggest installing Chromium (the open source project Chrome is derived from). Chromium is similar to Chrome but it’s still not the real Google Chrome..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we wil see the installation of google chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two methods to install Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphical install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Command line install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-graphical-method-begginers-method&quot;&gt;1. Graphical method [Begginer’s method]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are new to ubuntu and Linux world, this method is preferable(If you interested in administration, you can give a try with command line)
Firstly go to the official website for downloading chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;button style=&quot;cursor: pointer; color: whitesmoke; background-color: black; display: inline-block;text-decoration: none; border: none; max-width: 100%; font-size:20px&quot;&gt;Download Google chrome
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see a download link there, now click the “Download chrome” button to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/linux/chrome-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome download page&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%; border:0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can see tat it is asking to select between two versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/linux/chrome-select.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome download page&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%; border:0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to install chrome for other linux systems like Fedora, openSUSE download the “rpm package”, but we are now installing it for Ubuntu, download the ubuntu package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading, open the downloaded file by double clicking it. Now,Ubuntu software center is opened and chrome will be staged for installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/linux/chrome-install.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome download page&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%; border:0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just press “install”, google chrome will be installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-command-line-method-advanced-or-interested-users&quot;&gt;2. Command line Method (Advanced or Interested user’s)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is generally annoying for begginer users. So, follow the below steps carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install chrome we need to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type the command in he terminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the download process is finised, try to install it using the following command in the directory where you have downloaded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, your system will be installed with chrome!!
Coming to updating the chrome, you can update it while you are updatong your systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="Linux" /><category term="PC" /><category term="Operating system" /><category term="Chrome" /><summary type="html">Google chrome is one of the most used popular browsers.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/linux/ubuntu-logo.gif" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Some new Android 11 Features for developers</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/android11-developer-preview-1-for-developers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Some new Android 11 Features for developers" /><published>2020-02-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-02-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/android11-developer-preview-1-for-developers</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/android11-developer-preview-1-for-developers/">Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. 

### 1. 5G experiences

5G brings consistently faster speeds and lower latency to more users around the world. With 5G you can extend your Wi-Fi app experiences -- such as streaming 4K video or loading higher-res game assets -- to mobile users, or you can build new experiences designed specifically for 5G.

+ **Dynamic meteredness API** - with this API you can check whether the connection is unmetered, and if so, offer higher resolution or quality that may use more data. The API to include cellular networks, so that you can identify users whose carriers are offering truly unmetered data while connected to the carrier’s 5G network. 
+ **Bandwidth estimator API** - API for 5G to make it easier to check the downstream/upstream bandwidth, without needing to poll the network or compute your own estimate. If the modem doesn’t provide support, we make a default estimation based on the current connection.

### 2. New screen types

Device makers like POCO, RealMe, Xiaomi, Nokia etc.. continuing to innovate by bringing exciting new form-factors and device screens to market. Extended support for these in the platform, with APIs to let you optimize your apps. 

+ **Pinhole and waterfall screens** - Apps can manage pinhole screens and waterfall screens using the existing display cutout APIs. If you want, a new API lets your app use the entire waterfall screen including the edges, with insets to help you manage interaction near the edges. 

### 3. Privacy

+ **Scoped storage** - Google continued it's work to better protect app and user data on external storage, and made further improvements to help developers migrate more easily. This preview release includes several enhancements, such as opt-in raw file path access for media, updated DocumentsUI, and batch edit operations in MediaStore. Along with these technical changes, based on your input, we are also giving you more time to make the migration and the changes will apply to your apps when they target Android 11.

### 4. Security 

+ **Biometrics** - It has expanded it's biometrics support to meet the needs of a wider range of devices. BiometricPrompt now supports three authenticator types with different levels of granularity -- strong, weak, and device credential. It also decoupled the BiometricPrompt flow from the app’s Activity lifecycle to make it easier to integrate with various app architectures, and to improve the transaction UI. All apps using biometric auth should move to the BiometricPrompt APIs, which are also available in AndroidX for compatibility with earlier versions of Android.
+ **Platform hardening** - It expanded use of compiler-based sanitizers in security-critical components, including BoundSan, IntSan, CFI, and Shadow-Call Stack. It is also enabling heap pointer tagging for apps targeting Android 11 or higher, to help apps catch memory issues in production. These hardening improvements may surface more repeatable/reproducible app crashes in your code. It has used HWAsan to find and fix many memory errors in the system, and it now offer HWAsan-enabled system images to help you find such issues in your apps.
+ **Secure storage and sharing of data** - Apps can now share data blobs easily and more safely with other apps through a BlobstoreManager. The Blob store is ideal for use-cases like sharing ML models among multiple apps for the same user.
+ **Identity credentials** - Android 11 adds platform support for secure storage and retrieval of verifiable identification documents, such as ISO 18013-5 compliant Mobile Driving Licenses.

### 5. App compatibility

+ **Easier testing and debugging** - To help you test for compatibility, it had made many of the breaking changes toggleable - meaning that you can force-enable or disable the changes individually from Developer options or adb. With this change, there’s no longer a need to change targetSdkVersion or recompile your app for basic testing. [ Check out the details here](https://developer.android.com/preview/test-changes).

There are also Updated greylists, Dynamic resource loader, New platform stability milestone in the new preview.

There are some improvements in Connectivity like Call screening service improvements, Wi-Fi suggestion API enhancements, Passpoint enhancements and Image and camera improvements like HEIF animated drawables, Native image decoder, Muting during camera capture, Bokeh modes.

Google released the first developer preview for Android 11 and it's a very earl stage and it comes with a fair features and changes.

Let's get started with 7 cool features on Android 11..

### 1. Chat Bubbles

Chat bubbles first appeared back with Android Q beta versions, but it was not released with the stable version. But now it was released with the Android R's first developer beta.
Chat bubbles are similar to Facebook Messenger’s Chat Heads feature. It shows a bubble when you get a new message.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/chat-bubbles-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chat Bubble&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;&quot;/&gt; 

Generally, chat bubbles can be used by any messaging apps, but as of now only Google Messages and Gmail apps are using it. You can open a chat bubble for a conversation by simply long-pressing on a message notification and tapping on ‘Show in chat bubble’. 

### 2. Insert images into notification replies

With this you can copy/paste, you can now insert assets directly into notification inline replies to enable richer communication as well as in the app itself. You’ll see image copy support in Chrome and image paste support via Gboard clipboard.

### 3. Improved Permissions

With Android 11, Google has made location permissions even more strict.
In Android 11, whenever an app requests a permission related to location, microphone, or camera, the user-facing permissions dialog contains an option called Only this time, as shown in Figure. If you selects this option in the dialog, you have granted the app a temporary one-time permission.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/one-time-permission.png&quot; alt=&quot;One time Permission&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;&quot;/&gt; 

### 4. Native Screen Recorder

Now you can access the built-in screen recorder functionality from the Quick Settings panel. Tapping on this starts a 3 second timer before the screen starts being recorded. There’s also a handy notification to stop, pause, or cancel the screen record.

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/android-11-native-screen-recorder-on.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen recorder&quot; style=&quot;width:350px; border:1px solid black;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/android-11-native-screen-recorder-start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen recorder&quot; style=&quot;width:350px; border:1px solid black; border:1px solid black;&quot;/&gt;

### 5. Improved Do Not Disturb

Android 11 also brings improvements to Do Not Disturb — mostly in that it gives better support for managing DND exceptions. You can set do not disturb exceptions for particular callers, specific apps, or just allow alarms and reminders to ring regardless of the DND status on your phone.

### 6. Scheduled Dark Mode

In android 10 Dark mode has been introuduced, system-wide. Now, it has some improvements like Scheduling it like

+ You can turn it on at sunset and can turn at sun rise.
+ You can also turn it on or of at a specific time. 

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/android/android-11-scheduled-dark-mode.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dark Mode Scheduling&quot; style=&quot;width:350px; border:1px solid black;&quot;/&gt;

### 7. Pin Apps in the Share Menu

You can now pin your apps, that you share the most content with. Now these cannot bu replaced by just random apps that are installed in your device.


#### Other Changes and Features

+ **Conversations** : Dedicated conversations section in the notification shade - users can instantly find their ongoing conversations with people in their favorite apps.</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="Google" /><category term="Android" /><summary type="html">Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/android11.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Creating a Simple python TelegramBot using Flask and deploying it in heroku.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Simple-python-telegram-bot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creating a Simple python TelegramBot using Flask and deploying it in heroku." /><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Simple-python-telegram-bot</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Simple-python-telegram-bot/">Writing code for python telegram bot is easy. We add some extra things to integrate with telegram. Follow me you can build a bot easily.. 

## Requirements for PythonTelegramBot :
Firstly, get your bot a token and a username.
Search for &quot;botfather&quot; in telegram. Now follow the instructions in the BotFather..
This is the link for the official BotFather [https://t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
+ Rember the username is unique, so if the username is taken, try another one.
+ Remember the API_TOKEN is confidential, secure it.
+ Else your bot can be controlled by others.

![New Bot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pytelebot/new_bot.jpg)     ![New Bot Created]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pytelebot/bot_done.jpg)

##### Now we need to install some libraries for getting started
`
pip3 install telebot 
pip3 install python-telegram-bot
`
### Our first program :
Here is the simple bot which echo's what you sent to it.
```python
  #!/usr/bin/python
  # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.
  # It echoes any incoming text messages.
  
  import telebot
            
  API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'
            
  bot = telebot.TeleBot(API_TOKEN)
            
            
  # Handle '/start' and '/help'
  @bot.message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])
  def send_welcome(message):
  bot.reply_to(message, &quot;\nHi there, I am EchoBot.\nI am here to echo your words. 
  Just send anything  and I'll send the same thing to you!\n&quot;)
            
            
  # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text'])
  @bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
  def echo_message(message):
  bot.reply_to(message, message.text)
                   
  bot.polling()
```
Now run the code by

`
python3 file_name.py 
`


This is a simple echo bot. What ever the message you send to it, it sends you the same message.

+ Below are some predefined commands for our bot, so with out typing the whole sentence we can just type the command for the output. 
```python
 @bot.message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])
```
Below this we should write the function that should be executed when the command is sent. 

**Till now we have written a simple program.** 

### Deploying PythonTelegramBot in Heroku
For deploying our bot we will use **Flask**, because for contacting bot we use webhooks method.
So, to install flask use,

`
pip3 install flask 
`

After installing we should change our code a little bit so as to work with flask. 

```python
  server = Flask(__name__)
  PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT', '8443'))
```

Use the below code at the end of the application.

```python
@server.route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST'])
  def getMessage():
      bot.process_new_updates([telebot.types.Update.de_json(request.stream.read().decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;))])
      return &quot;!&quot;, 200
  
  
  @server.route(&quot;/&quot;)
  def webhook():
      bot.remove_webhook()
      bot.set_webhook(url='Your_App_Name_Link_Here' + API_TOKEN)
      return &quot;!&quot;, 200
  
  
  if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
  server.run(host=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))
```
After this the final code looks like

```python

  #!/usr/bin/python
  # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.
  # It echoes any incoming text messages.
  
  import telebot
  from flask import Flask, request
  import os
  API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'
            
  bot = telebot.TeleBot(API_TOKEN)
  server = Flask(__name__)
  PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT', '8443'))          
            
  # Handle '/start' and '/help'
  @bot.message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])
  def send_welcome(message):
  bot.reply_to(message, &quot;\nHi there, I am EchoBot.\nI am here to echo your words. 
  Just send anything  and I'll send the same thing to you!\n&quot;)
            
            
  # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text'])
  @bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
  def echo_message(message):
  bot.reply_to(message, message.text)
  
  
  @server.route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST'])
  def getMessage():
      bot.process_new_updates([telebot.types.Update.de_json(request.stream.read().decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;))])
      return &quot;!&quot;, 200
  
  
  @server.route(&quot;/&quot;)
  def webhook():
      bot.remove_webhook()
      bot.set_webhook(url='Your_App_Name_Link_Here' + API_TOKEN)
      return &quot;!&quot;, 200
  
  
  if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
  server.run(host=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))    
```

**Now, we need the libraries that are used for this bot. So to get the librares use**

`
pip3 freeze requirements.txt
`

_You can see the libraries in &quot;requirements.txt&quot;. Don't remove the libraries that you don't know as they_ _are dependent libraries._
_Now we should create a &quot;Procfile&quot; and type this code in that file_

`
web: python3 file_name.py
`

**Don't change name of &quot;requirements.txt&quot; and &quot;Procfile&quot;('P' is capital).**
Now, open github and create your repository, after that upload your file_name.py,requirements.txt and Procfile to github.
Signup/Signin to heroku and Create a new app.
![Connected to Heroku]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pytelebot/hd_connect.png)
Now, go to the Deploy section and now connect to github, then after type your repository name and connect it.
![Bot deployed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pytelebot/bot_deployed.png)

Every thing is done. You are set to go
Now press come down and press deploy branch.
After successfull deployment you can use your bot.
**You can get your app name from settings section in heroku.**</content><author><name>puneeth</name></author><category term="python" /><category term="bot" /><category term="Telegram" /><category term="Flask" /><category term="Heroku" /><summary type="html">Writing code for python telegram bot is easy.

Although it serves the need of most Android users, there are few segment of people who are either interested to try new app stores or their needs are not met by the play store. This is why we have introduced the
**Alternatives of Google Play Store**.

We have divided this segment into three parts,


Alternative App Stores, Websites, Modified App Stores.

**1. Amazon App Store**   

![Amazon App Store]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/alternatives/google-play-store/amazon-app-store.png)

This App Store is from famous gaint **Amazon**. This app store used to be present in Google Play Store, but later it was taken over by Amazon. The main reason for recommandingthis app store is that, it lets the user to download a paid app for free once a day.

##### pros:
```
A paid app for free (One a day)
```
