<meta name="description" content="As we all know, the biggest challenge in internet marketing is getting traffic to your website. However difficult it may be, it is a must if you want to be successful. You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free. So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google? I am going to show you in 5 simple steps. Ok, here it goes: Step 1 Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2. Step 2 Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box. Step 3 Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4. Step 4 Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step. Step 5 Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google. Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come! The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free. Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful." />

It has quite a lot going for it lets talk about it one by one, starting from 1. The design its the same one as the previous gen iPad Pro and you will not be able to identify the previous from the latest one by just seeing the front which is covered with bezelless screen with a screen to body ratio of just below 83%.  2. Talking about the screen its the same old IPS LCD panel, with 120hz refresh rate which is found in the previous generation of iPad Pro. We would like to have seen an Oled panel with the same 120hz refresh rate, but thats kind a nitpicking.  3. Good froward taught about the back side the the iPad Pro has got 2 new sensors, an ultra wide sensor of 12MP and Lidar sensor to aid with depth sensing and ARKIT stuffattached in the same fashion like the iPhone 11.  4. Talking about the Processing power,the iPad Pro is powered by A12Z Bionic Chipset which according to apple is more powerful than windows PC. Going by the previous gen iPad Pro the claims might end up becoming true. .  Conclusion : Is the new iPad Pro worth paying attention to ? The simple answer would be Yes,The iPad Pro is trying to be the everything machine be it a tablet or an laptop. It already was a great tablet but talking about laptop apple is trying its best thats evident by the fact that it now Provides Proper cursor support(mouse) for the iPad Pro and it has a smart keyboard which has a trackpad below the keyboard now its all upto the iPad OS which decides whether the iPad Pro can really be a computer for all intensive purposes.

Now coming to linux, we can’t just define it. It is very addictable using linux.  1. Performance:: If we talk about performance, Linux runs faster than windows, even with the improved graphics compared to previous it is faster. If we open android studio in windows whole system goes down, but in linux we can able to run some other programs parallelly. 2. Updates:: Windows updates are very irritating, they need need to reboot for every update and it takes a lot of time to update i. e reboot. But in linux the updates are very fast and very rare updates need reboot that too it takes very less time. 3. Flavours:: Windows only has one theme, and which is less customizable. Linux has many flavours and many of them are highly customizable. Some of them are Linux mint, Ubuntu, Kali Linux and many more. . 4. Security:: No system is safe, when comes to security, though Linux is more secure compared to Windows. There are various constraints for this.  Windows is widely is used OS, so it is a target.  Windows is preparatory software i. e source code is hidden, so bugs and flaws can only fixed by the company. But Linux is opensource so anyone can fix it. 5. Support:: Microsoft Windows support isn’t bad, but linux has more forums and chatroom’s and websites where support comes from enthusiastic, where as for windows we should relay on the Company forums where employees give answers much time.

    "title": "How to Rank on First Page of Google",
    "body": "2020/03/03 - As we all know, the biggest challenge in internet marketing is getting traffic to your website. However difficult it may be, it is a must if you want to be successful. You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free. So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google? I am going to show you in 5 simple steps. Ok, here it goes: Step 1Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2. Step 2Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box. Step 3Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4. Step 4Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step. Step 5Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google. Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come! The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free. Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful. "

    "title": "Challenges Faced By Android App Developers",
    "body": "2020/03/02 - While developing mobile apps, businesses target Android due to its massive worldwide mobile operating system market share. Alphabet has made Android available as an open source mobile platform. Also, it updates the mobile operating system at regular intervals with new features and enhancements. But the penetration rate of individual versions of the mobile operating system differs. Alphabet does not regulate the Android smartphones, tablets, and phablets manufactured by various companies. Hence, the devices manufactured by different companies come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. That is why; it becomes essential for developers build mobile apps by targeting a wide range of devices powered by different versions of Android. While planning, developing, and testing the mobile app, they need to focus extensively on its accessibility, functionality, performance, usability, and security of the mobile app to keep the users engaged regardless of their choice of Android device. Also, they need to explore ways to make the app deliver personalized user experience across varying devices and operating system version. They further need to address a number of common challenges to develop a robust Android app. Understanding 7 Common Challenges Faced by Android App Developers1) Software FragmentationAs mentioned earlier, the market share of individual versions of Android differs. According to the latest data released by Google, the most recent version of its mobile operating system – Nougat – has a market share lower than its predecessors – Marshmallow, Lollipop and KitKat. Each new version of Android comes with several new features and enhancements. The developers have to include specific features in the app to make it deliver optimal user experience by taking advantage of these new features. At the same time, they also need to ensure that the app delivers rich and personalized user experience on devices powered by older versions of Android. The developers have to target multiple versions of Android to make the application popular and profitable in the short run. 2) Varying Hardware FeaturesUnlike other mobile operating systems, Android is open source. Alphabet allows device manufacturers to customize its operating system according to their specific needs. Also, it does not regulate the Android devices launched by various manufacturers. Hence, the devices come with varying hardware features despite being powered by the same version of Android. For instance, two devices powered by Android Nougat may differ from each other in the category of display screen size, resolution, camera and other hardware features. While developing an Android app, the developers need to ensure that it delivers personalized experience to each user by accessing all hardware features of his device. 3) No Uniform User Interface Designing Process or RulesGoogle has not released any common user interface (UI) designing process or rules for the mobile app developers. Hence, most developers build Android apps without following any standard UI development process or rules. When the developers create custom UI interfaces in their own way, the apps do not look or function consistently across different devices. The incompatibility and diversity of the UI affects the user experience delivered by the Android app directly. The smart developers opt for responsive layout to keep the UI consistent across many devices. Also, the developers have to test the UI of their mobile app comprehensively by combining both real devices and emulators. But often developers find it daunting to design a UI that make the app look consistent across various Android devices. 4) API IncompatibilityMost developers use third-party APIs to enhance the mobile app’s functionality and interoperability. But the quality of third-party APIs available for Android app developers differs. Some APIs are designed for a particular version of Android. Hence, these APIs do not work on devices powered by different versions of the mobile operating system. The developers have to explore ways to make a single API work on different versions of Android. But they often find it challenging to make the app work smoothly on different Android devices with the same set of APIs. 5) Security FlawsIts open source nature makes it easier for device manufacturers to customize Android according to their specific needs. But the openness and its massive market share made Android vulnerable to frequent security attacks. There are many instances when security of millions of Android devices has been impacted by security flaws or bugs like Stagefright, ‘Certifi-gate’ mRST, FakeID, Installer Hijacking and TowelRoot. The developers have to include robust security features in the application and use latest encryption mechanism to keep the user information secure despite targeted security attacks and security flaws in Android. 6) Android Search Engine VisibilityThe latest data posted on various website depict that Google Play Store has a much higher number of mobile apps than Apple App Store. Also, a large percentage of Android device users prefer free apps to paid apps. Hence, the developers have to promote their mobile apps aggressively to accomplish higher download numbers and implement app monetization options. They also need to implement a comprehensive digital marketing strategy to promote the app by targeting the most relevant users. Many developers have to avail the services of digital marketing professionals to promote their apps aggressively. 7) Patent IssuesThe users have option to choose from several Android apps offering identical features and functionalities. But developers often find it daunting to build apps with unique features and functionality. They often include features and functionalities in the app that make it similar to a number of apps available in the same category in the Play store. Unlike Apple, Google does not implement stringent guidelines to evaluate the quality of new apps being submitted to its app store. Lack of standardized quality assessment guidelines often make developers address issues related to patent. Some developers have to design and modify their apps in future to avoid patent issues. Most Android app developers nowadays work in agile development environment to build Android apps rapidly. They have to coordinate consistently with QA professionals, and participate actively in the mobile app testing process. Hence, the developers also need to address a number of common issues in Android app testing. "

    "body": "2020/02/29 - Google chrome is one of the most used popular browsers. Firefox has improved a lot lately and is a better choice specially from the privacy point of view. However, if you are an ardent fan of Google Chrome, I won’t force you to ditch Chrome and move to Firefox. Ofcourse chrome is available for linux, but Google Chrome is not an open source and if you try to install Google Chrome from Ubuntu Software Center, you won’t find it there. It will probably suggest installing Chromium (the open source project Chrome is derived from). Chromium is similar to Chrome but it’s still not the real Google Chrome. . Now, we wil see the installation of google chrome. There are two methods to install Google Chrome.  Graphical install Command line install1. Graphical method [Begginer’s method]: If you are new to ubuntu and Linux world, this method is preferable(If you interested in administration, you can give a try with command line)Firstly go to the official website for downloading chrome. Download Google chrome You will see a download link there, now click the “Download chrome” button to download.  Now, you can see tat it is asking to select between two versions.  If you want to install chrome for other linux systems like Fedora, openSUSE download the “rpm package”, but we are now installing it for Ubuntu, download the ubuntu package. After downloading, open the downloaded file by double clicking it. Now,Ubuntu software center is opened and chrome will be staged for installation.  Now, just press “install”, google chrome will be installed. 2. Command line Method (Advanced or Interested user’s): This process is generally annoying for begginer users. So, follow the below steps carefully. To install chrome we need to download it. wget https://dl. google. com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debType the command in he terminal After the download process is finised, try to install it using the following command in the directory where you have downloaded sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64. debThat’s it, your system will be installed with chrome!!Coming to updating the chrome, you can update it while you are updatong your systems.

    "title": "Some new Android 11 Features for developers",
    "body": "2020/02/28 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. 1. 5G experiences: 5G brings consistently faster speeds and lower latency to more users around the world. With 5G you can extend your Wi-Fi app experiences – such as streaming 4K video or loading higher-res game assets – to mobile users, or you can build new experiences designed specifically for 5G.  Dynamic meteredness API - with this API you can check whether the connection is unmetered, and if so, offer higher resolution or quality that may use more data. The API to include cellular networks, so that you can identify users whose carriers are offering truly unmetered data while connected to the carrier’s 5G network.  Bandwidth estimator API - API for 5G to make it easier to check the downstream/upstream bandwidth, without needing to poll the network or compute your own estimate. If the modem doesn’t provide support, we make a default estimation based on the current connection. 2. New screen types: Device makers like POCO, RealMe, Xiaomi, Nokia etc. . continuing to innovate by bringing exciting new form-factors and device screens to market. Extended support for these in the platform, with APIs to let you optimize your apps.  Pinhole and waterfall screens - Apps can manage pinhole screens and waterfall screens using the existing display cutout APIs. If you want, a new API lets your app use the entire waterfall screen including the edges, with insets to help you manage interaction near the edges. 3. Privacy:  Scoped storage - Google continued it’s work to better protect app and user data on external storage, and made further improvements to help developers migrate more easily. This preview release includes several enhancements, such as opt-in raw file path access for media, updated DocumentsUI, and batch edit operations in MediaStore. Along with these technical changes, based on your input, we are also giving you more time to make the migration and the changes will apply to your apps when they target Android 11. 4. Security:  Biometrics - It has expanded it’s biometrics support to meet the needs of a wider range of devices. BiometricPrompt now supports three authenticator types with different levels of granularity – strong, weak, and device credential. It also decoupled the BiometricPrompt flow from the app’s Activity lifecycle to make it easier to integrate with various app architectures, and to improve the transaction UI. All apps using biometric auth should move to the BiometricPrompt APIs, which are also available in AndroidX for compatibility with earlier versions of Android.  Platform hardening - It expanded use of compiler-based sanitizers in security-critical components, including BoundSan, IntSan, CFI, and Shadow-Call Stack. It is also enabling heap pointer tagging for apps targeting Android 11 or higher, to help apps catch memory issues in production. These hardening improvements may surface more repeatable/reproducible app crashes in your code. It has used HWAsan to find and fix many memory errors in the system, and it now offer HWAsan-enabled system images to help you find such issues in your apps.  Secure storage and sharing of data - Apps can now share data blobs easily and more safely with other apps through a BlobstoreManager. The Blob store is ideal for use-cases like sharing ML models among multiple apps for the same user.  Identity credentials - Android 11 adds platform support for secure storage and retrieval of verifiable identification documents, such as ISO 18013-5 compliant Mobile Driving Licenses. 5. App compatibility:  Easier testing and debugging - To help you test for compatibility, it had made many of the breaking changes toggleable - meaning that you can force-enable or disable the changes individually from Developer options or adb. With this change, there’s no longer a need to change targetSdkVersion or recompile your app for basic testing.  Check out the details here. There are also Updated greylists, Dynamic resource loader, New platform stability milestone in the new preview. There are some improvements in Connectivity like Call screening service improvements, Wi-Fi suggestion API enhancements, Passpoint enhancements and Image and camera improvements like HEIF animated drawables, Native image decoder, Muting during camera capture, Bokeh modes. source: Turning it up to 11: the first Developer Preview of Android 11 "

    "body": "2020/02/20 - Android has led the way towards the future of mobile, with new technologies like 5G to foldable displays to machine learning built into the core. Google released the first developer preview for Android 11 and it’s a very earl stage and it comes with a fair features and changes. Let’s get started with 7 cool features on Android 11. . 1. Chat Bubbles: Chat bubbles first appeared back with Android Q beta versions, but it was not released with the stable version. But now it was released with the Android R’s first developer beta. Chat bubbles are similar to Facebook Messenger’s Chat Heads feature. It shows a bubble when you get a new message.  Generally, chat bubbles can be used by any messaging apps, but as of now only Google Messages and Gmail apps are using it. You can open a chat bubble for a conversation by simply long-pressing on a message notification and tapping on ‘Show in chat bubble’. 2. Insert images into notification replies: With this you can copy/paste, you can now insert assets directly into notification inline replies to enable richer communication as well as in the app itself. You’ll see image copy support in Chrome and image paste support via Gboard clipboard. 3. Improved Permissions: With Android 11, Google has made location permissions even more strict. In Android 11, whenever an app requests a permission related to location, microphone, or camera, the user-facing permissions dialog contains an option called Only this time, as shown in Figure. If you selects this option in the dialog, you have granted the app a temporary one-time permission.  4. Native Screen Recorder: Now you can access the built-in screen recorder functionality from the Quick Settings panel. Tapping on this starts a 3 second timer before the screen starts being recorded. There’s also a handy notification to stop, pause, or cancel the screen record.  5. Improved Do Not Disturb: Android 11 also brings improvements to Do Not Disturb — mostly in that it gives better support for managing DND exceptions. You can set do not disturb exceptions for particular callers, specific apps, or just allow alarms and reminders to ring regardless of the DND status on your phone. 6. Scheduled Dark Mode: In android 10 Dark mode has been introuduced, system-wide. Now, it has some improvements like Scheduling it like  You can turn it on at sunset and can turn at sun rise.  You can also turn it on or of at a specific time. 7. Pin Apps in the Share Menu: You can now pin your apps, that you share the most content with. Now these cannot bu replaced by just random apps that are installed in your device. Other Changes and Features:  Conversations : Dedicated conversations section in the notification shade - users can instantly find their ongoing conversations with people in their favorite apps. "

    "title": "Creating a Simple python TelegramBot using Flask and deploying it in heroku.",
    "body": "2020/02/18 - Writing code for python telegram bot is easy. We add some extra things to integrate with telegram. Follow me you can build a bot easily. . Requirements for PythonTelegramBot :: Firstly, get your bot a token and a username. Search for “botfather” in telegram. Now follow the instructions in the BotFather. . This is the link for the official BotFather https://t. me/BotFather  Rember the username is unique, so if the username is taken, try another one.  Remember the API_TOKEN is confidential, secure it.  Else your bot can be controlled by others.    Now we need to install some libraries for getting startedpip3 install telebot pip3 install python-telegram-bot Our first program :: Here is the simple bot which echo’s what you sent to it.  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot       API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot. TeleBot(API_TOKEN)             # Handle '/start' and '/help' @bot. message_handler(commands=['help', 'start']) def send_welcome(message): bot. reply_to(message,  \nHi there, I am EchoBot. \nI am here to echo your words.  Just send anything and I'll send the same thing to you!\n )             # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text']) @bot. message_handler(func=lambda message: True) def echo_message(message): bot. reply_to(message, message. text)           bot. polling()Now run the code by python3 file_name. py This is a simple echo bot. What ever the message you send to it, it sends you the same message.  Below are some predefined commands for our bot, so with out typing the whole sentence we can just type the command for the output.   @bot. message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])    Below this we should write the function that should be executed when the command is sent.  Till now we have written a simple program. Deploying PythonTelegramBot in Heroku: For deploying our bot we will use Flask, because for contacting bot we use webhooks method. So, to install flask use, pip3 install flask After installing we should change our code a little bit so as to work with flask.  server = Flask(__name__) PORT = int(os. environ. get('PORT', '8443'))Use the below code at the end of the application. @server. route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST']) def getMessage():   bot. process_new_updates([telebot. types. Update. de_json(request. stream. read(). decode( utf-8 ))])   return  ! , 200   @server. route( / ) def webhook():   bot. remove_webhook()   bot. set_webhook(url='Your_App_Name_Link_Here' + API_TOKEN)   return  ! , 200   if __name__ ==  __main__ : server. run(host= 0. 0. 0. 0 , port=int(os. environ. get('PORT', 5000)))After this the final code looks like  #!/usr/bin/python # This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.  # It echoes any incoming text messages.   import telebot from flask import Flask, request import os API_TOKEN = 'Your_API_Token_Here'       bot = telebot. TeleBot(API_TOKEN) server = Flask(__name__) PORT = int(os. environ. get('PORT', '8443'))            # Handle '/start' and '/help' @bot. message_handler(commands=['help', 'start']) def send_welcome(message): bot. reply_to(message,  \nHi there, I am EchoBot. \nI am here to echo your words.  Just send anything and I'll send the same thing to you!\n )             # Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text']) @bot. message_handler(func=lambda message: True) def echo_message(message): bot. reply_to(message, message. text)   @server. route('/' + API_TOKEN, methods=['POST']) def getMessage():   bot. process_new_updates([telebot. types.

So to get the librares use pip3 freeze requirements. txt You can see the libraries in “requirements. txt”. Don’t remove the libraries that you don’t know as they are dependent libraries. Now we should create a “Procfile” and type this code in that file web: python3 file_name. py Don’t change name of “requirements. txt” and “Procfile”(‘P’ is capital). Now, open github and create your repository, after that upload your file_name. py,requirements. txt and Procfile to github. Signup/Signin to heroku and Create a new app. Now, go to the Deploy section and now connect to github, then after type your repository name and connect it. Every thing is done. You are set to goNow press come down and press deploy branch. After successfull deployment you can use your bot. You can get your app name from settings section in heroku. "

You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free.</p>

<p>So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google?</p>

<p>I am going to show you in 5 simple steps.</p>

<p>Ok, here it goes:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>
Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>
Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>
Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>
Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>
Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google.</p>

<p>Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come!</p>

<p>The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free.</p>

<p>Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful.</p>
